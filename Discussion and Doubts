Problems:
1. We should be able to turn off the battery at any state. - Solved
2. The battery empty state is redundancy
3. We should be able to charge and discharge the battery at the same time - This is not possible, eliminate condition

Doubts?:
1. FaultDetected - from all states, can it go to batteryBroken?
2. BatteryFull - to discharging ??
